# A little bit about myself
I’m a motivated Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, pursuing a B.S. with a Global Health Certificate. I bring hands-on experience in software engineering through internships and part-time roles, with a strong background in backend and frontend development using languages like C++, Clojure, Java and JavaScript/TypeScript. I'm proficient in full-stack development, embedded systems, and circuit design, and I have a passion for creating user-centric solutions. I have proven ability to work across interdisciplinary teams, lead community initiatives, and manage projects. I'm skilled and I have plenty of experience in Java, SQL, React, STM32, Linux, Docker, REST, RTOC, I2C, SPI, UART, and AWS. I also have interests in coding for social good, learning new languages, baking, horseback riding, film cameras, and cultural engagement.
