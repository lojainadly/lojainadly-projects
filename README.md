# A little bit about myself
I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, holding a B.S. degree with a Certificate in Global Health. I bring hands-on experience in software engineering through internships and part-time roles, with a strong background in backend and frontend development using languages like C++, Clojure, Java and JavaScript/TypeScript. I'm proficient in full-stack development, embedded systems, and circuit design, with experience working on STM32 microcontrollers and using protocols such as I2C, SPI, and UART.

In embedded systems, I’ve worked with RTOS environments like FreeRTOS, and I’m comfortable reading and interpreting hardware schematics, debugging with oscilloscopes, and performing hands-on soldering, including designing PCB layouts. I also have experience with Linux environments and tools like Docker, REST APIs, and AWS.

I have a passion for creating user-centric solutions and coding for social good. I’ve led community initiatives, worked across interdisciplinary teams, and successfully managed projects from concept to deployment. Outside of work, I enjoy learning new languages, baking, horseback riding, film photography, and exploring different cultures.
